The first one should be how to install(how to generally use your project or set-up for editing in their machine).
This should give the users a concrete idea with instructions on how they can use your project repo with all the steps.
Following this steps, **they should be able to run this in their device.**
A method I use is after completing the README, I go through the instructions from scratch and check if it is working. -->
